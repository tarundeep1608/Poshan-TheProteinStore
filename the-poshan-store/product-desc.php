              <br>2. Multiple orders placed for same product at the same address;

              <br>2. Shipping

              <br>2.1 What locations do you deliver to?

              <br>We primarily ship through our channel partner Delhivery. Our coverage areas are limited to the areas covered by our channel partner. In case, for whatever reason, your delivery address is not covered by our existing partners, on request, we will attempt to ship through alternate channel partners.

              <br>2.2 How can I track the delivery of my order?

              <br>We usually email you the tracking reference number of your shipment. You can request an update at talktous@poshan.co

              <br>Please allow 5-7 days for your order to reach. If you are in Mumbai we’ll probably get your order to you sooner than that. Metro areas usually reach within 3-5 days.

              <br> 2.5 Why is the CoD option not offered in my location?

              <br> The availability of CoD depends on the ability of our courier partner servicing your location to accept cash as payment at the time of delivery. Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable on delivery depending on the destination and your order value might have exceeded this limit.
